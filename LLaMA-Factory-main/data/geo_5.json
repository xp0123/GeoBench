If we have a right triangle ABC, it will verify what conditions are already in the proof state. If the proof state symbolically knows the three lengths of the sides, and they satisfy that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs is equal to the square of the hypothenuse, it will add the proper orthogonal relation to the proof state. If the proof state has a perpendicular statement and two lengths of sides of the correspoding right triangle, it will add the lconst predicate corresponding to the missing length. The operation does not solve the algebra, it verifies if enough information exists and if that is the case it numerically gets the missing side when using the famous formula.\n(4) Cyclic kite: This theorem says that a cyclic kite is always formed by two symmetric right triangles.\n\nWhen outputting, only provide the serial number without the text following it.
